# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on properly configuring and setting up the Rakuten Recipe API key for the existing healthcare food application. The application already has Rakuten Recipe API integration implemented, but needs proper API key configuration to enable real recipe data instead of mock data. This includes environment variable setup, configuration validation, and error handling for API key management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the Rakuten Recipe API key through environment variables, so that the application can access real recipe data from Rakuten's API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read the RAKUTEN_APPLICATION_ID from environment variables
2. WHEN the RAKUTEN_APPLICATION_ID is provided THEN the system SHALL use real Rakuten API calls instead of mock data
3. WHEN the RAKUTEN_APPLICATION_ID is missing or empty THEN the system SHALL fall back to mock recipe data
4. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate the API key format
5. IF the API key format is invalid THEN the system SHALL log a warning and use mock data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and setup instructions for the Rakuten API key, so that I can easily configure the application in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the application THEN there SHALL be clear documentation on how to obtain a Rakuten API key
2. WHEN configuring environment variables THEN there SHALL be example files showing the required format
3. WHEN the API key is missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages with setup instructions
4. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether real or mock data is being used

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want API key validation and health checks, so that I can verify the Rakuten API integration is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate the Rakuten API key by making a test request
2. WHEN the API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL log an error with specific details
3. WHEN API requests fail due to authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN the API is unreachable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to mock data
5. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle the error appropriately and retry with backoff

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration management, so that I can use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific API keys
2. WHEN running locally THEN developers SHALL be able to use their own API keys
3. WHEN the API key is not set THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate it's running in mock mode
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the API configuration SHALL be automatically applied
5. IF multiple API keys are needed THEN the system SHALL support configuration for different Rakuten services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless recipe functionality regardless of API configuration, so that the application works even when the API key is not configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Rakuten API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL seamlessly fall back to mock recipe data
2. WHEN using mock data THEN the user interface SHALL remain fully functional
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN users SHALL not experience application crashes or errors
4. WHEN switching from mock to real data THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent
5. IF the API key becomes invalid during runtime THEN the system SHALL handle the transition gracefully
